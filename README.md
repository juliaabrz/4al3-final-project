# Predicting Diabetes Health Status Using Various Machine Learning Models: A Comprehensive Dataset and Performance Analysis

Welcome to the **4AL3 Final Project Repository**! This repository contains all the important data and files required for the project.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to utilize [CDC Diabetes Health Indicators](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators) data to predict an individual's health status as one of the following:
- **Diabetic**
- **Pre-Diabetic**
- **Healthy**

### Approach
1. Multiple machine learning models will be implemented and evaluated based on accuracy. We chose K-Nearest Neighbours, Neural Network, and SVM.
2. Results from the models will be thoroughly analyzed.
3. The goal is to identify the **most efficient model** for predicting health status.
